# My Portfolio
We can find on this page my past projects that I worked on to build up my programming and analytics skills. 

# [1. Image-Dog-Breed-Classifier](https://github.com/phamou/Image-Dog-Breed-Classifier/blob/master/good-boy-identifier.ipynb)
## Overview
When I see a dog and happen to take a picture of it, I would love to know what breed it is. This notebook is to apply deep learning methods to identify the breed of these cute fluffs and present my results through data visualization.

## Technologies used:
* TensorFlow
* TensorHub (MobileNetV2)
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

### Result visualization

# [2. Bulldozer-Price-Predictor](https://github.com/phamou/Bulldozer-Price-Predictor/blob/master/bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb)
## Overview
The goal is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment at auction day based on its usage, equipment type, and configuration using regression and time series analysis. 

The biggest challenge of this project was to convert all data types to numerical values in order to be used in the Random Forest Regressor model.

## Technologies used:
* Scikit-Learn
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

### Feature importance of price predictor model

# [3. Heart-Disease-Predictor](https://github.com/phamou/Heart-Disease-Predictor/blob/master/heart-disease-classification.ipynb)
## Overview
Predicting heart-disease using machine learning (Classification)
This notebook will look into using Python-based ML and data science libraries in an attempt to build a ML model capable of predicting whether someone has heart disease or not based on their medical record.

The problem will be divided in these different sections:

1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features 
5. Modelling 
6. Experimentation

This notebook features many visualization tools to understand possible correlations.

## Technologies used:
* Scikit-Learn
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

### Correlation matrix of all the features

### Scatter plot of maximum heart rate and age

### Bar graph between sex and heart disease frequency
